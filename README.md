## VR FPS Game using Unity + Oculus Quest 2

<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p>With advancements in the field of virtual reality and the boom of metaverse, the technology underlying modern games is progressing rapidly. Virtual reality along with modern Artificial Intelligence algorithms have resulted in impressive results and immersive experiences for users.

These agents have been trained to navigate the map using Navmesh Agent, and shoot us whenever they sense our presence. The game ends if the user kills every agent before his health level finishes. This project highlights the potential of VR in making games more interactive and impressive. </p>
