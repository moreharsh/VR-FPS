<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p>With advancements in the field of virtual reality and the boom of metaverse, the technology underlying modern games is progressing rapidly. Virtual reality along with modern Artificial Intelligence algorithms have resulted in impressive results and immersive experiences for users.
